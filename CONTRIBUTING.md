How to add system dependency support for an R package
=====================================================

1. Create a directory with the same name as the R package you are adding support for. The directory **MUST BE** case sensitive.

```bash
mkdir packages/<r_package_name>
```

2. Create a bash script in the directory named `install` and give it executable permissions

```bash
touch packages/<r_package_name>/install
chmod 755 packages/<r_package_name>/install
```

3. Write your install bash script to install all the dependencies of your R package.  Be sure to include the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -x
set -e
```

4. Create a `test.R` file in the same directory.

```bash
touch packages/<r_package_name>/test.R
```

5. Write this R script to install the R package and run some basic code to ensure that the package is installed correctly and functional.

4. Test your install by running these commands:

```bash
make test-trusty-[r_package_name]
make test-xenial-[r_package_name]
```
