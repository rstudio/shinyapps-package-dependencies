shinyapps-package-dependencies
==============================

Some R packages require other software and libraries to be installed on the host server in order for the R package to
function. This repository is used in [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) to install those dependencies if a
user's shinyapp utilizes an R package that requires other libraries/software to be install.

To contribute to this repository, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rstudio/shinyapps-package-dependencies/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
